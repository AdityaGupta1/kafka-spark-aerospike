= kafka-spark-aerospike

A Java project that pulls data from Apache Kafka, manipulates it through Apache Spark, and sends it to an Aerospike database

== Getting Started

=== Kafka Setup

Instructions are available on the https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart[Kafka quickstart page].

Follow steps 1 - 4 to start the server and a producer (message sender).

=== Spark Setup

. Download and install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK (Java Development Kit)] if you don't have it already

. Download https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] if you don't have it already
.. Extract the Maven archive (should be called something like `apache-maven-3.5.0-bin.tar.gz`)
.. Add the `bin` folder inside to your PATH:
... Windows:
+
Refer to https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/[this] webpage for help with adding directories to your PATH

... Mac:
+
Run the following command and replace `/path/to/maven/bin` with the actual path to your `bin` folder
+
[text]
----
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/maven/bin
----

. Download Spark http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html.tgz[here].
.. Extract the archive and navigate to it in Terminal or Command Prompt; replace `/path/to/spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7` with the actual path to the `spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7` folder
+
[text]
----
cd /path/to/spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7
----

. Package the applications and its dependencies into one jar
+
[text]
----
mvn package
----

. Submit the application
+
[text]
----
spark-submit --class "Main" --master local[*] target/kafka-spark-aerospike-1.0.jar 1000 "localhost:2181" "test"
----
+
* `1000` is the batch duration (in milliseconds); it specifies how often the stream updates
* `localhost:2181` is the ZooKeeper IP address; if you used a different port when setting up ZooKeeper, specify that port here
* `test` is the topic to consume data from; if you used a different topic when setting up Kafka, specify that topic here

{empty} +
Once Kafka and Spark setup is complete, you should be able to type messages into the Kafka server console window and receive them in the Spark application console window.

=== Aerospike Setup

Instructions are available on the http://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/install[Aerospike Installation Guide].

Aerospike can run on Linux normally or on Windows/OS X using Vagrant-managed virtual machines.
